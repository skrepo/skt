# Note: 
# Does the superuser account always have uid/gid 0/0 on Linux?
# Yes. There's code in the kernel which explicitly checks for uid 0 when needing to check for the root user, which means that root always has at least uid 0.

# Is the name of the user account with uid 0 always root?
# No. root is just a name, listed in /etc/passwd or some other authentication store. You could just as well call the account admin, and the OS itself won't care, but some applications might not quite like it because they expect there to exist a privileged account named root. Calling the uid 0 account on a *nix root is a very strongly held convention, but it isn't required by the system.



# Best effort drop superuser rights

# drop root privileges by changing uid and gid and return that user name
# Do nothing if root from the ground up, return "root" then
# Also do nothing if currently non-root
